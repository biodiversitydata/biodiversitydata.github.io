This five-day training course, co-organized by the [FRB-CESAB](https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/en/about-the-foundation/le-cesab/), the [PNDB](https://www.pndb.fr/), and [GBIF France](http://www.gbif.fr/) aims to work on the different stages of the data lifecycle, from acquisition to opening, including management, storage and the drafting of data papers.

We will 1) contextualize the issues surrounding the understanding, sharing and (re)use of biodiversity data and metadata, and 2) enhance the skills of communities involved in one or more stages of the data lifecycle.
